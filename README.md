# Read Me Studio

## Description

This app is designed to generate a professional README.md file based on prompts made with inquirer in the Command Line. These READMEs are generated automatically in a dist file. READMEs are valuable parts of any open source project as they allow anyone who wants to contribute to see how that app was designed, what its purpose is, and how they can contribute
